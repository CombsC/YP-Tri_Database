        YPTC  is the premier organization for connecting and engaging young professionals in their 20’s, 30’s, and 40’s in professional, personal and community development activities throughout the Tri-Cities.

        Every month we hold social events at local restaurants and wineries.  It’s a low stress, casual way to meet others who are like you.

        Expanding your social circle is just the beginning. YPTC offers professional development opportunities including leadership training, mentoring with other professionals in your field, and a chance to establish yourself professionally with your peers.

        Come and check out a few YPTC events.  We’d love to meet you!
